Improvements:
    [ ] make color picker dialog use our custom dialog

    [ ] improve the file dialog
        [ ] make the file dialog use our custom dialog
        [ ] make it self-contained for reusability

    [ ] run configurations (project entrypoint + args)
        [ ] support running specific file/module (not only current file)
        [ ] add per-configuration arguments
        [ ] add per-configuration working directory
        [ ] add per-configuration interpreter override (optional)
        [ ] execute via terminal pipeline (single execution path)
            # this is planned after the major refactor
            # current "run current file" stays as the fast path

    [ ] script/task runner integration (terminal-backed)
        [ ] add saved script tasks (bash/command)
        [ ] open in new or reused terminal tab (configurable)
        [ ] safe command construction (quoted paths, cwd handling)
            # initial implementation can be command-posting to terminal
            # this covers venv refresh and other maintenance scripts

    [ ] stop flow polish
        [✔] first press = graceful stop
        [ ] second press = force stop
        [ ] keep timer escalation as fallback safety net
            # current model works on timer; second-press is safer UX

    [ ] symbol-aware refactor tools
        [ ] rename symbol
        [ ] replace symbol
            # find/replace-in-files is now the bridge workflow
            # implement after refactor

    [ ] icon/branding polish
        [✔] create temporary app icon
        [✔] create simplified small-size icon
        [ ] produce full icon family (16/24/32/48/64/128/256 + full mark)
        [ ] create monochrome variant
            # tiny icon now reads much better when scaled down

    [ ] config boundaries hardening
        [✔] move project metadata/state into .tide
        [✔] ensure project.json reload applies only project-domain settings
        [✔] keep theme/global ide prefs strictly in ide settings
            # project settings and ide settings should stay clearly separated

    [ ] diagnostics/search panel polish
        [✔] add find and replace in files (indexed/non-filtered files only)
        [✔] show results in dockable panel
        [ ] add optional preview/selection controls for replace operations

    [ ] in the project.json store the explorers expanded folders so they persist across sessions
    [ ] in the project.json store the code folding of files.
        # double check when file is opened and be smart about restoring
    
    [ ] ctrl+d to duplicate selected text
    

Bugs:
    [✔] folded block selection behavior
        # selecting a folded header now selects the whole folded block
        # enables safer copy/paste/indent operations on collapsed scopes

    [✔] interpreter selection ux gap
        # users no longer need to type raw interpreter paths
        # added browse flow and project environment discovery

    [✔] project metadata clutter in project root
        # moved ide project metadata into .tide for cleaner roots

    [✔] project.json live apply completeness
        # when project.json is edited/saved, all project-domain changes should be honored
        # include project name, session/open editors, interpreter mappings, and run settings
        
    [ ] when search/replace is visible, hitting enter in the editor goes to the next result.
        # this should only happen if the filter text box is in focus
        
    [ ] find in files will not go to the result if the file containing the result is already open
        # if the file is already open, navigate to that editor and place the cursor where it belongs
